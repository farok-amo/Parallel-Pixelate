#####[COMCUDA_mosaic_assignment](https://github.com/RSE-Sheffield/COMCUDA_mosaic_assignment)
#####The task is to implement a simple pixelate filter on a photographic image input to produce a photo mosaic. The mosaic should decompose the image into a grid of regular tiles, and average the pixels within each tile.
#####Such a task can be surprisingly slow using conventional methods. the goal of the assignment is to implement the task using OpenMP (multiprocessing programming with CPU threads), and CUDA ( parallel computing platform and programming model developed by NVIDIA for general computing on GPUs); and compare their performance.
